We build on the zine and (art)books fair to become an interactive exhibition and cultural event. We stay in the margins, we keep printing, and together we hope to engage with the potential of publishing and printed matter to generate social change. By elaborating the idea of the art fair, we want to emphasise the special ecology of art and publishing that emerges in the encounters across international and local actors in the Netherlands.", " ",
